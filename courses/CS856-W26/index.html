<h3 class="header"> Overview</h3>
<p>
Transport protocols are an essential, complex, and continuously evolving part of network communications. They bridge the gap between distributed applications and the lossy, best-effort network layer by providing key services such as data segmentation and reassembly, data loss detection and recovery, flow control, and congestion control. These protocols handle every piece of data exchanged between application processes on different endpoints.
They are asynchronous and event-driven, have to handle numerous nontrivial corner cases to account for the changing network and receiver conditions and packet losses and delays, and significantly impact the network quality of service experienced by distributed applications and online services using the network. As such, it is critical to develop an accurate understanding of the performance characteristics of transport protocols under different application workloads and network conditions prior to deployment. 


<br/><br/>

In this course, through course projects and presentations, we will do a deep dive on recent advances in network transport protocols and analyze and explore their performance characteristics. 
This performance exploration, which will be part of the course project and student presentations, can be analytical or empirical, depending on the individual student's interest and skills.
Students can pick their focus from a wide range of protocols, including but not limited to: 
<ul>
  <li> The "classic" TCP and its many variants
  <li> QUIC, developed for faster web transfers
  <li> RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)
  <li> Receiver-driven transport protocols proposed for RPC-like traffic in data centers (e.g., Homa, dcPIM, NDP)
  <li> Recent proposals for customized network transport for AI workloads
  <li> <i>&lt; your favorite protocol &gt;</i> 
</ul> 

</p>


<h3 class="header">Grading</h3>

<p>
Final grades will be based on the following components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Presentations:</strong> 35%</li>
  <li><strong>Participation in discussions:</strong> 15%</li>
  <li><strong>Final project report:</strong> 50%</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the presentation component, students are expected to deeply understand their
chosen protocol and associated papers and lead a full class discussion (60-75 minutes). 
One week before the presentation, students must send the instructor a presentation plan, see slides for details.
</p>


<h3 class="header" id="course-calendar">Schedule </h3>

<p>
This course is structured around a semester-long project on transport protocols.
The schedule below outlines the major milestones. <u> See the slides for the inroductory lectures for details. </u> 

The exact order of topics and presentation dates may be adjusted during the term.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Weeks 1–2:</strong> Introductory lectures [<a href="lectures/week1.pdf">week1</a>][<a href="">week2</a>].
In the first week, each student will select a transport protocol and a network
setting to study in depth over the term.
</p>

<p>
<strong>First half of the term (roughly until Reading Week):</strong>
Students will learn about and teach others their chosen protocol and network
setting. This phase focuses on:
<ul>
  <li>Presenting the protocol and its design goals</li>
  <li>Modeling the protocol in a domain-specific language (DSL)</li>
  <li>Clearly specifying assumptions and properties of the target applications and network</li>
  <li>Getting started on reproducing results from the original paper to establish an experimental setup</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Second half of the term:</strong>
We will explore the effectiveness of the chosen protocols by critically evaluating
their assumptions and experimental setups. Students will examine:
<ul>
  <li>Whether the evaluated workloads and network settings are appropriate</li>
  <li>What baselines the protocol is compared against</li>
  <li>What scenarios or workloads may be missing</li>
  <li>Conditions under which the protocol may perform poorly or undesirably</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Final Report:</strong>
A 6-page final project report is due at the end of the term (<strong>April 23</strong>).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Alternative project option:</strong>  One group of up to two students can instead build a unified network simulation environment
for evaluating transport protocols (e.g., using ns-3). This group will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use one class session (instead of the first presentation) to demo the simulator</li>
  <li>Support other students in using the simulator throughout the term</li>
  <li>Continue improving the simulator during the second half of the course</li>
  <li>Submit the same 6-page final project report</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="header" id="students-with-disabitily">Note for Students with Disabilities</h3>

<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.

<h3 class="header" id="academic-integrity">University and Faculty of Math Policy on Academic Integrity</h3>

<b>Academic Integrity:</b> In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.
[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]

<br/><br/>

<b>Grievance:</b> A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Please read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.

<br/><br/>

<b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a>.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.

<br/><br/>

<b>Avoiding Academic Offenses:</b> Most students are unaware of the line between acceptable and unacceptable academic behaviour, especially when discussing assignments with classmates and using the work of other students. For information on commonly misunderstood academic offenses and how to avoid them, students should refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/academic-misconduct">Office of Academic Integrity's site on Academic Misconduct</a> and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-matters/academic-integrity">Faculty of Mathematics' site on Academic Integrity</a>. 

<br/><br/>

<b>Appeals:</b> A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72 - Student Appeals</a>.
